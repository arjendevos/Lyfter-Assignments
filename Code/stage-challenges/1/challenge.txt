"CLEAN UP THE WORDS"

# Description
You have a list of words. Letters of these words are mixed with extra symbols, so it is hard to define the beginning and end of each word. Write a program that will clean up the words from extra numbers and symbols.

# Example
Input:
> (--9Hello----World...--)
> Can 0$9 ---you~
> 13What213are;11you-123+138doing7

Output:
> hello world
> can you
> what are you doing


# How do I do it?
- Load the string(s) from the input.txt
- Find a way to clean them up
